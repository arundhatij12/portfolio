        <h2>My journey into web-dev</h2>
        <p>Hey, this is my first blog and I wanted to start with how I got into coding.
            So currently I'm a first year engineering undergrad pursuing Electronics and Telecommunication engineering.
            
            Nah, I only wanted to study CSE but I wanted a decent college and a decent branch both.
            I have had Java in my 12th grade as the optional paper and I thoroughly enjoyed it as well.
            
            I stumbled upon Tanay Bhaiya's youtube channel and my sister who herself is a roc8.careers alumna pushed me into completing the mark15 assignments.
            
            Although a beginner in web development , I have actually started enjoying the process of building things up and 
            that's pretty much why I love taking out the time despite my exams going on every now and then.

            For the starters, I did all the videos from level 0 of Tanay's Youtube Channel.
            Then I started looking for some free resources from Youtube for github and hosting and came across few codeWithHarry videos as well.
            
I would love to dive deep into the world of web development and learn as much as I can. Would be real nice to start early in the first year of college.
 Currently I'm also reading javascript.info which I feel is a very good fundamental to Javascript.
